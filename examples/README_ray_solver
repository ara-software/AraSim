From the conversation between Amy Connolly and Christopher Weaver,

     to compile,

     make -f ray_solver_makefile


     to run,

     ./ray_solver --src_x=0 --src_y=0 --src_z=-100 --trg_x=100 --trg_y=0 --trg_z=-100

     which means rays between the source point (0,0,-100) and target point (100,0,-100).
